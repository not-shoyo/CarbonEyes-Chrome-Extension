# **CarbonEyes**

> TRINIT_Hackathon_Submission (TRINIT_594092-U6BRG487_DEV)

A Chrome Extension which calculates total Carbon Emission using data transferred from various websites visited using the **browsers local storage**.

It consists of a popup for quick values and an extended website with detailed information about which websites have emitted the most to least amount of carbon.

Video demonstration can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N4sDaqi0SSdcY0UGafsXf2HUmv0BDQWN/view?usp=sharing).

Shows the Data Transferred for the current website and also the emission caused by the current website

To get Additional Information about the emission caused by the user. Click on the “_See Your Stats_” button

### **Webpage**

It consists of the **all time total** Co2 Emission by the user until he/she decides to use the “_Clear History_” button 

There are 2 graphs on the webpage. The **live** line chart shows the change in emission vs time whereas the live donut graph shows the percentage of Co2 Emitted by **each domain**.

Also there is a feature to expand different domains and see which domain specific **sessions / tabs** cause more carbon emission.

The domains can also be **ranked** on the basis of Emission to see most to least contribution towards carbon footprint.

The Extended Website also shows which domain is Green, Semi Green and Not Green depending on the **average** of total carbon emission from a domain by the number of sessions ( in this case tabs ) contributing to the specific domain.

From the inception of the idea to the implementation of the extension, we have kept in mind the unseen effects of data transfer through our browsers and have designed & developed **CarbonEyes** to minimize its own emissions. We believe the extension can play a crucial role in helping other developers make websites cleaner and help internet users be more wary of their own impact on the planet.
